# client-less
Develop client applications NOT linked to a specific OS

As I planned to work on a wrapper for Salesforce DX my experience with Salesforce Ant left me with a bitter taste. If you initiate your project with implementation teams in mind there is a common wall you will be hitting soon or later: *The developer OS of choice*. The point of this project is to address the issue of the target machine OS compatibility in a world of client-server in general and SaaS in particular and even more in the case of Salesforce implementations.
